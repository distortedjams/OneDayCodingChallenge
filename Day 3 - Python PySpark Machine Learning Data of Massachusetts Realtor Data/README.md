This Python project uses machine learning techniques to estimate the values of houses in Massachusetts. The project is built on PySpark, a powerful framework for distributed computing. The model used is a DecisionTreeRegressor model, which is trained on a dataset of house prices and relevant features such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, size of the lot in acres, and the size of the house in square feet.

Usage Instructions:

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
Ensure that Python 3 and PySpark are installed on your machine.
Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor.
Run the following command to install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt.
Locate the main.py file and open it.
In the main.py file, you can adjust the values for bed, bath, acre_lot, and house_size to reflect the details of the house you want to estimate.
Run the main.py file.
The predicted value of the house will be displayed in the console.

Note: The project uses a pre-existing dataset realtor-data.csv. However, if you have your own dataset with similar features, you can replace the realtor-data.csv file with your own dataset and adjust the relevant code in the main.py file.This Python project uses machine learning techniques to estimate the values of houses in Massachusetts.
